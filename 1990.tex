\section{May 25--June 8: Ibiza}
\label{1990:Ibiza}

What I didn't know back then: This marked the last flight for a while, taking a Belair DC9 to get to Ibiza and back. This time we stayed in San Antonio. I don't remember that much of the trips, but we were part of the daily morning jogging animation, as well as hanging around the pool. There was a daily kid's disco with some games being played (which was one by my little brother). Then we also participated in a treasure hunt where we had to split into teams. This time my sister's team won. She wasn't that happy that her team won biscuits while we others (as loosers) won bonbons. I was responsible for watering the plants on the roof terrace and the balcony. We also went to church once, I was surprised how the Spanish children were allowed to run around without anybody telling them to sit down and behave. Clearly there was a lot more of singing going on that in Germany, not that I understood any of it. This time the beaches were small but nice (and also close) with lots of seashells, and also fish swimming around. At some point we had dinner somewhere in the middle of the island - for sure chicken was part of the menu. I also wrote my first postcard to my godmother, going for a postcard depicting fireworks over the citadel of Ibiza City. Well things one does, once one learnt how to read and write (in some countries kid's start school kinda late). Ibiza City was also the only major tourist sight we did, climbing up all the way to the top of the citadel and the cathedral. From there we had a superb view of the harbour and the huge car ferry, at least I thought back then it was huge. For once my older brother and I had our own room with a bathroom attached (yes we were the big kids).
