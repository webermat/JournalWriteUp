\section{April 25--April 30: Madrid DIS2009}
\label{2009:Madrid}

The DIS2009 (Deep-Inelastic Scattering) conference wanted to hear about the prospects of the LHC regarding event-shape measurements at the LHC. Since that was the topic of my PhD thesis and we all hoped that we indeed would get collision data this year, my boss nominated me for that talk. I was selected and got myself a hotel by Madrid Chamartin. The conference itself took place at the congress centre just opposite of the Bernabeu stadium of Real Madrid. Having been in Madrid just the year before for the first time, I didn't stay for any additional days.\\

April 25: Saturday:\\
Having arrived a bit earlier I decided to go to the city centre, visiting the Almudena cathedral. The cathedral took about 110 years to be finished only in 1993. The outside is of a neobaroque style while the interior leans more towards a gothic outlook. The ceiling is very colourful, the same hold for the square cupola with a large traditional style apse painting. The crypt was free to visit back then, built in a neo-romanesque style.\\

April 29: Wednesday:\\
This was the free afternoon, I decided to go to Toledo. Since that train wouldn't leave until later I chose to do a short trip to the outskirts of Getafe, to see the cathedral there. The retabel was really nice, the church itself nice too, particular considering it had been a normal city church for the longest time. Back by the Atocha station i still had time to walk through the palm gardens which have been set up in the middle of the station hall, pretty unusual and unique. Once I arrived in Toledo after a short train ride, I climbed the stairs up to the Alcazar and then walked along nice little roads to the cathedral, on of the largest of the country. Back then photography was not allowed (that changed in the meanwhile). The decoration is breathtaking, from side altars, a large main altar (though that one can only be viewed through a giant screen) and the fantastic baroque El Transparente altarpiece on the outside of the choir screen, covering the full height of the cathedral with statues literally climbing up the altar walls up to a window. The sacristy is also pretty nice, filled with several paintings by El Greco. Another church which I enjoy visiting in Toledo is the large baroque Jesuit church. There you can climb on the roof with nice views of the old town. On my way back I walked up a little hill top to see the Castillo de San Servando, which overlooks the old down of Toledo on the other side of the Tajo river.\\

During the evenings I had a couple of dinners in the old town of Madrid, for example the Plaza Mayor, and walked through the little parks by the Royal palace. The conference dinner was at a fancy roof top restaurant but other than that I just flew home on the last day of the conference, so no time to see anything else.

\section{June 23--July 8:CTEQ09 \& New York City}
\label{2009:US}

June 23:\\
I didn't want to take a bus from Chicago to Madison, so I decided to fly instead via Paris and Cincinnati to Madison. Having arrived in Cincinnati I had to spend quite boring 6 hours at the airport, and then about 30 minutes before our flight was supposed to depart, Delta cancelled our flight due to a technical problem. We were told we could talk to the call center or queue by the counter. I decided to go to the counter, just seconds later people found out the call center didn't work anyway. I was told I could get on a flight to Chicago O'Hare, then taking the bus from there (exactly what I had wanted to avoid originally), but what can you do. I was told to rush the flight would leave in 20 minutes, I still hoped for my luggage to get on board, at least they were happy to hear an Air France checked bag would look very distinct. Three more guys were from my original flight were on the one to Chicago. Surprisingly my bag did make it on the plane so once I got it, I got on the bus to Madison, but when the driver asked me where I wanted to get off, I just had no idea. Seems there are three stations, and since I didn't plan being on a bus, I didn't inform myself about where bus stations are located at. I told him I would get somewhere close to the University, so I was told to get of at Union station, the last one of this bus. About 3 1/2 h later, by this time I had been awake longer than 24 h, we finally arrived at Union station. I got off, got into a taxi with 2 other folks, told the driver where i wanted to go, he drove for about 45 minutes, I got off, gave a generous tip, and finally checked in (having told them I would arrive about 5 h earlier), and finally got some sleep. Waking up the next day I walked to the auditorium ONLY to realize that the bus station was only 500 m or a 5 minute walk away from the hotel. Since then I have sworn to myself never to get on a taxi again, unless there is absolutely no other possibility.\\
