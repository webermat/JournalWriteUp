\label{2023:Blansko}

Co-Travellers:\\
Janina \& Kevin: Kevin and Janina visited me for a couple of days in Vienna. But since most of Vienna's sights can be visited within two days, we decided to do a side trip. Since the Moravian Karst and its caves are quite famous (and were also recommended by Czech folks), we decided to visit a cave in that area. I got to know Janina as summer student, Kevin did his PhD at CERN as well, after a couple of day trips Janina thought a long weekend in Vienna might be fun, and since I work usually from the office, the bandwidth is also good enough for two people to work remotely from my place:\\

\section{June 2-June 6: Stockholm area}
\label{2023:StockholmI}

Now why Sweden: Actually I had already planned to visit Sweden around October for a Madonna concert. While planning what to do around those days, I realised that I couldn't possibly fit everything I actually wanted to do inside. Particularly certain palaces which I visited already back in 2013 would be closed (also for the sake of finally being allowed to take photos). I actually had wanted to spend a couple of days in Germany around Corpus Christi, but then train service went on strike multiple times, and flights to other places got more and more expensive. Though by shifting from the days off from end to beginning of the week ticket prices dropped considerably, thus 14 days before the fact I booked a 4 day weekend in Sweden with a hotel way out in the suburbs.\\

June 2:\\
I typically plan a bit in advance, so I checked for transfer options about a week before arriving, opting for regional trains. What I didn't realise was that due to a train derailment on May 27 no single train was passing by the airport anymore. The person on the information desk just said no trains, take the bus from Terminal 4. Thus I rushed onto the onstanding bus, and had to move out of downtown by the Metro again. Combined with a flight delayed by over an hour, I arrived by the hotel only shortly before 2 am instead of the originally planned shortly before midnight.\\

June 3: \"Angelsberg \& Stockholm:\\
Getting in late would have been fine if I had not planned getting up early to get out of town (and having a coffee before at the train station while at it). The first stop of the day was \"Angelsberg. In this village you can find one of the oldest still functioning ironworks with machinery from the late 19th century. Since the area is privately owned you can only get inside of the buildings on very few selected days during summer or as part of a larger group booking. I had made sure to reserve my spot in one of the tours. Unfortunately the place is not famous enough that many foreigners show up, thus I was the only non-swedish person among a group of 7. While the others had long explanations, i got told a couple of sentences on each spot. I did read up on some of the things previously thus I wasn't totally lost, but i got maybe 15 minutes out of the over 2 h tour.\\
Since the tour lasted far longer than usually I had to run the over 2 km within 15 minutes (not that much up for long runs anymore) and just made it in time for the train.\\
Back in Stockholm I took the Metro straight to Skogskyrkogarden cemetery (after a short stop for ice-cream and coffee). Now that cemetery is situated largely within forest and meadows throughout which you find the scattered tomb stones. There are also a couple of chapels, but those are only up for viewing via a guided tour, which takes places once a day. Otherwise unlike in other cemeteries all buildings are locked off, thus not that much to do than walking a big through the area.\\ 
Then I got off the Metro by Slussen and walked up to the Maraiberget view point, which is the most known sport for photos of Stockholm's old town which just sits at the end of the M\"alaren lake. Now I always try to meet up with people who I know in towns when i visit. Thus I met up with my former office mate Rickard, had a couple of drinks and walked over to the Skeppsholmen island, before getting back to old town for food and some sunset photos.\\

Stockholm: Skogskyrkogarden****, Mariaberget Viewpoint*****\\

June 4: Stockholm, Ulriksdal \& Rosersberg:\\
You may think staying in the Stockholm area means sleeping in. But not quite, at least not if the Vasa Museum opens up already at 8:30. I decided to go straight to Gamla Stan to get some nice morning shots when the town is still not crowded and maybe finding a nice cafe which is open early. Open early on a Sunday seems to be not a thing in Sweden though. At least if there had been cafes open I missed to realise. Thus I walked over to Djugarden to enjoy the impressive wreck of the Vasa, one of the largest ships of its time. But too unstable to even make it out of the harbour on its maidan voyage. Thankfully for us that it had been more or less fully conserved (without the pain though, but who would care about that). At least the museum cafe opened, so I got some snacks, coffee while listening to some ABBA.\\
Then the plan was to go to the cathedral. But that one was banned morning visits, officially due to religious service (which happened 90 minutes after I tried to step in, and the ban would finish 90 minutes after the service finished, so no cathedral for me). The royal chapel was supposed to open by 10, but then also it was closed off for service by 11, thus I decided to rush a bit through the royal palace to get at least some glimpse of it (you can guess it already 10 minutes before the start they didn't let you inside anymore either). Now the royal palace is one of the largest in Europe. A bit unassuming from the outside, most of the inside is of late Baroque and Rococo style, with some modern touches though, even one room with additions from the early 2000s. Unlike in 2013 now windows were even more closed off, so it all appeared a bit darker than 10 years previously. Then by Gertrud church the same game, religious service planned 30 minutes later == no visit allowed.\\
