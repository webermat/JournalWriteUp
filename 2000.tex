\section{May 18-May21: Munich}
\label{2000:Munich}

This trip was part of the so-called Hochrheinseminar, a school outing for folks particularly interested in STEM subjects as extracurricular activity besides school. My topic was back then chemistry (a bit ironic I then later went to focus on physics instead). The main part of the science outings was a visit of the Graching FRM II reactor which was in construction at that point, we were also told about the old reactor. For sure I thought it is a very exciting topic and maybe one of the many reasons I went for a career in research a couple of years later.\\
Now did I only do what highschool students do (aka celebrate too late, going to restaurants or bars), but the whole group also did an Opera outing, watching Bizet's Carmen at Staatsoper. OK I only saw half of it, since on the very same day Bayer Leverkusen lost a bit unexpectedly vs Unterhaching, while Bayern M\"unchen won an unexpected Bundesliga championship. Clearly I had to be present at the impromptu Meisterfeier at Marienplatz.\\
Otherwise my friend Vera and I did a bit of tourism too, visiting Frauenkirche and Theatinerkirche, as well as the Munich Residence, the royal winter palace which is one of Germany's largest palaces. It was really impressive, and I enjoyed that you could take photographs (and you still can up to now, one of the few places in Bavaria which still allows it).\\
