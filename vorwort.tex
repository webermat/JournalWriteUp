\chapter{Preamble}

When you hear about someone's travel you often hear how awesome it was and amazing (or the opposite: everything was bad, from the hotel, the food in restaurants, overcrowded beaches etc). Unlike those stories, trips are in general a fun time to see or discover something interesting while spending time friends or family merged with unfortunate things like public transport on strike, broken down cars, getting lost, overpriced sights, and other mishaps. You won't only hear about the sunny days, beautiful mountain sceneries, deserted incredible beaches, or days without smog in the huge metropolis, but also about days getting completely soaked in pouring rain, flooded metro stations. The current version takes you to four continents (no Australia, Antarctica or South America as of yet), obviously still open for that to happen in future updates. You will get to hear a huge amount about the beauty of places and the fun you can experience in about 700 places in close to 40 countries (and still counting). What is your take on a comment along the lines of: the Vatican is not a real country? or countries you have only been at an airport don't count?
