Another morning we went to the Beatus caves, one of the larger caves in Switzerland with an entrance just next to a waterfall. I remember we did a longer hike, and we walked over meadows with lots of cows on. My mum reminded us that we should stay away from cow poop, but she used the dialect word (Kuhdeitsche), which I never had heard of. So I asked her what that stuff is, notably just stepping into the cow shit at that very same moment. Clearly mum wasn't too happy, even my younger brother who was just 2 years old at that point can tell that story. Anyways the hike went on for longer and longer and longer, thus my parents decided to cut it short and take the bus back at the first occasion without getting to the place which was originally foreseen as destination.
