\label{2007:Zermatt}

After having been in Geneva for over half a year but without doing barely anything I decided it was time to take on Swiss mountains, this time going to Zermatt on the last weekend before Christmas. On the way I thought that Sion looks so nice with its castles, that i should maybe get off and pay a visit, but then I decided to stick to the original plan. I thought the Santa Claus church tower of St Niklas looked very cute. I enjoyed a first view of the Bisgletscher over Randa before finally arriving in Zermatt where I was blown away by seeing the Matterhorn for the first time. Clearly I had made my choice early that the Kleinmatterhorn was the peak to take the cable car up to, and indeed it didn't disappoint. I visited the glacier palace, did enjoy the view from the platform and had lunch in the cafeteria. Once I was down in the village again i had a quick view of Zermatt's church (nothing interesting to see there though).\\
