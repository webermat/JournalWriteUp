%\begin{abstract}
%In this thesis the measurement of hadronic event shapes in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV is presented. The data sample is collected with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 pb$^{-1}$. Jets constructed using particle flow techniques are used as input for the event shape calculation. Normalized event-shape distributions are shown to be robust against detector resolution effects and various sources of systematic uncertainty. Several event-shape distributions are compared with five models of QCD multijet production after detector simulation. For two selected event shapes - central transverse thrust and central thrust minor - the distributions are corrected for detector effects and compared to six models of QCD using the SVD regularization method. The model dependence of the unfolding technique and the error propagation are discussed in detail. Results are cross-checked using an alternative unfolding method and an alternative method of jet reconstruction.

%Pont du Gard: one of the old aqueducts in Southern France, still in perfect condition, seen on a pit stop of a school trip going to Barcelona in 2001


%Troy: the famed town destroyed by the greeks after a decade of war. Indeed the acropolis had been an important trading centre for a couple of centuries up until Roman times, seen with the family in 2000.

%The castles of Bellinzona: three castles guard the town of Bellinzona, one of two sites in Ticino, still missing out on the other one, I had seen that place with a couple of other physicists back in 2010 during our free social afternoon from a PhD school.

%The Mujedar art in Aragon: a couple of buildings in Teruel and Zaragozza are part of this item, among those the old palace of Aljaferia which has its origins in Moorish times, before the Spanish kings remodelled parts of it. Seen with Riju in 2016.

%Mont Saint Michel: a fortified island in the wadden sea just by the coast of France dominated by an old gothic abbey, a lot of measures have been undertaken to give the island back its character after a dam almost completely lead to the island attaching itself to the mainland. Seen on my own in 2015.

%Kronborg: the castle of Helsingor, made famous by Shakespeare. In fact one of the largest Renaissance castle including the still existing fortifications in Denmark, the inside is a bit plain. Seen in 2013 on my own.

%The cathedral precinct of Pisa: Although mainly famed for its wrongly constructed campanile, the Duomo is in fact one of the most precious example of Romanesque architecture in Italy, you should rather see the cathedral inside than climbing the tower. Seen in 2002 with the family and once again on my own in 2014.

%Coimbra: This Portuguese town is famous for its university buildings from 12th to 16th centuries, including the beautiful library (no photography allowed), as well as the old and new cathedral and churches with royal tombs. Seen on my own in 2012.
